# Link a PR with a bounty

This guide will explain how contributors can link a Github PR with an accepted bounty.

## Link your PR

Once you've accepted a bounty, you should start working on it.
When you're ready to submit your work, just create a Github PR that references the issue.

You can do this by adding a comment in the PR that starts with
`/githoney` and calls the `link-bounty` command.

The `link-bounty` command has the following parameters:

- `bountyId`: the id of the bounty, which can be found as a
  comment by the bot in the issue that describes the task.

**Example:**

```
/githoney link-bounty --bountyId 111
```

<Callout type="info">
  For detailed information on available commands please refer to the [Bot
  commands](./bot_commands) section of the documentation.
</Callout>

The Githoney bot will give you a thumbs-up üëç once it receives your command.
It will then link the PR with the bounty, so the maintainer can review your work and approve the PR.
