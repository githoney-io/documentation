# Claim the reward

This guide will explain how contributors can claim their reward once the PR that
fulfills the tasks has been approved and merged by the maintainer.

## Do the work

Goes without saying, the first step to claiming a bounty reward it have
submitted the work that fulfills the tasks requested by the original issue.

As with any open-source contribution, the maintainers will be the ones reviewing
the PR. Make sure that everything described in the bounty issue has been covered
as part of the PR (eg: scope, acceptance criteria, docs, tests, etc).

## Flag pull-request as ready

The process continues by notifying the maintainer that your code is ready for
review and merge. If you're PR is in draft mode, the usual procedure is to
change it to "ready for review". If you know who is responsible for the review
process, you can make it explicit by requesting a review from the PR settings.

Regardless of the method you use, you should understand that this is part of the
normal Github PR workflow and not a process managed by the GitHoney bot.

## Wait for the merge

Once your PR has been reviewed and merged, the bot will get notified and will
automatically submit a on-chain transaction to change the state of the bounty
contract.

You will see a new comment from the bot explaining that the bounty has been
fulfilled and that the reward can be claimed. This comment will also provide a
link that will take you to a simple web page that allows you to sign and submit
the withdrawal transaction.

Make sure to sign it using the Cardano wallet that holds the "contributor" role
token that was sent during the process of accepting the bounty. The on-chain
contract makes sure that only the holder of this token is allowed to withdraw
the reward.
