2. Click on the **Install** button.

During installation, the GitHub App will request the following permissions:

*   **Read access to metadata and organization custom properties:** This allows the bot to understand your repository structure and settings.
*   **Read and write access to issues and pull requests:** This is essential for the bot to interact with bounties, post comments, and update issue statuses.

## Congratulations! 

You've successfully installed and configured the GitHoney GitHub App for your organization. Now you can start using the app to manage bounties for your open-source projects. üêù
