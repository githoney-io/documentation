# Claim a bounty

This guide will explain how contributors can accept an existing bounty by
creating a Github PR that references it.

## Start a pull-request

The process starts by creating a new PR. This PR can be from a branch in the
original repository or from a fork.

It's recommended to start as a draft PR to make it explicit that the task hasn't
been finished. It doesn't have to contain any code at this point, it can be just
an empty branch.

## Accept the bounty

Once you've created a PR, link it to the bounty you want to claim.

You can do this by adding a comment in the PR that starts with
`/githoney` and calls the `accept-bounty` command.

Since only one contributor can be assigned to a bounty, it's crucial to do this early! This avoids the disappointment of putting in effort only to find someone else has already claimed the reward.

The `accept-bounty` command has the following parameters:

- `bountyId`: the id of the contract of the bounty, which can be found as a
  comment in by the bot in the issue that describes the task.
- `address`: the Cardano wallet address that will be used to claim the reward if
  / when the PR get approved and merged.

**Example:**

```
/githoney accept-bounty --bountyId abc111 --address addr1xxx
```

<Callout type="info">
  For detailed information on available commands please refer to the [Bot
  commands](./bot_commands) section of the documentation.
</Callout>

The Githoney bot will give you a thumbs-up üëç once it receives your command. It will then send a special "contributor" token to the Cardano wallet address you provided. This token is your key to claiming the bounty reward once your PR is merged.
