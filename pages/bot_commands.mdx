# Bot Command reference

The GitHoney bot interactions can be thought as analogous to interacting
with a CLI, with the big difference that commands and outputs are expressed as
Github comments in the corresponding issue.

## `attach-bounty`

This command should only be executed in Github issues, otherwise it will throw an
error. It will specify the reward of the bounty and the duration of it.
Whoever comments will be the **maintainer** of the bounty and should sign the
transaction. The response will be a comment with the bounty id that could be
used to accept the bounty.

### Args

- `amount`: the amount in ADA that the contributor will obtain once the
  bounty tasks have been completed. The minimum value is 10 ADA.
- `deadline`: The duration (in days) from the creation of the bounty that the
  contributor has available to complete the task. The minimum value is 6 days.
- `address` the address of the wallet that will be used to deposit the reward in
  the contract.
- `network` the network on which the contract will be created. It only accepts
  two values `preprod` and `mainnet`. If this parameter is ignored, it will be
  set to "preprod" by default.

<Callout type="warning">
  If the address format does not match with the network, the contract creation
  will fail.
</Callout>

Here's the example of a comment that can be used to create a bounty in mainnet that
provides a reward of 5000 ADA, that needs to fulfilled within 60 days and that will
be deposited from the address `addr1xxx`.

```
/githoney attach-bounty --amount 5000 --address addr1xxx --deadline 60 --network mainnet
```

## `fund-bounty`

This command should only be executed in Github issues, otherwise it will throw an
error. Allows any user to deposit more rewards to the bounty, this user will become
a sponsor and should sign the transaction.

### Args

- `tokens`: the list of tokens and their quantity to add, for now, only ADA is supported.
  The format is `tokenA=amountA&tokenB=amountB&...&tokenZ=amountZ`.
- `address` the address of the wallet that will be used to deposit the reward in
  the contract.

Here's the example of a comment that can be used to fund a reward with 500 extra
ADA and will be deposited from the address `addr1xxx`.

```
/githoney fund-bounty --tokens ADA=500 --address addr1xxx
```

## `accept-bounty`

This command should only be executed in Github pull requests, otherwise it will
throw an error. Allows any user to become the bounty contributor, that is, the person
who will solve the task.

### Args

- `bountyId`: the id of the bounty, which can be found in the bot response of the
  `attach-bounty` comment in the issue that describes the task.
- `address`: the address of the wallet that will be used to claim the reward when
  the task is completed and the pull request merged.

Here's the example of a comment that can be used to accept the bounty with id `123`
using the address `addr1xxx`.

```
/githoney accept-bounty --bountyId 123 --address addr1xxx
```
