# Bot Command reference

The GitHoney bot interactions can be thought as analogous to interacting
with a CLI, with the big difference that commands and outputs are expressed as
Github comments in the corresponding issue.

## `create-bounty`

This command should only be executed in Github issues, otherwise it will throw an
error. It will specify the reward of the bounty and the duration of it.
Whoever comments will be the **maintainer** of the bounty and should sign the
transaction. The response will be a comment with the bounty id that could be
used to accept the bounty.

### Args

- `tokens`: the amount of tokens you want to add. (Currently, only ADA is supported. Format: `tokenA=amountA`).
  The developer who fulfills the bounty will receive 95% of this tokens. (Minimum: ADA=10)
- `duration`: The duration (in days) from the creation of the bounty that the
  contributor has available to complete the task. The minimum value is 5 days.
- `address` the address of the wallet that will be used to deposit the reward in
  the contract.

<Callout type="warning">
  If the address format does not match with the network, the contract creation
  will fail.
</Callout>

Here's the example of a comment that can be used to create a bounty in mainnet that
provides a reward of 5000 ADA, that needs to fulfilled within 60 days and that will
be deposited from the address `addr1*`.

```
/githoney create-bounty --tokens ADA=200 --address addr1* --duration 14
```

## `sponsor-bounty`

This command should only be executed in Github issues, otherwise it will throw an
error. Allows any user to deposit more rewards to the bounty, this user will become
a sponsor and should sign the transaction.

### Args

- `tokens`: the list of tokens and their quantity to add, for now, only ADA is supported.
  The format is `tokenA=amountA&tokenB=amountB&...&tokenZ=amountZ`.
- `address` the address of the wallet that will be used to deposit the reward in
  the contract.

Here's the example of a comment that can be used to fund a reward with 500 extra
ADA and will be deposited from the address `addr1*`.

```
/githoney sponsor-bounty --tokens ADA=500 --address addr1*
```

## `accept-bounty`

This command should only be executed in Github issues, otherwise it will
throw an error. Allows any user to become the bounty contributor, that is, the person
who will solve the task.

### Args

- `bountyId`: the id of the bounty, which can be found in the bot response of the
  `create-bounty` comment in the issue that describes the task.
- `address` the Cardano wallet address that will be used to claim the reward if
  / when the PR get approved and merged.

Here's the example of a comment that can be used to accept the bounty with id `111`
using the address `addr1*`.

```
/githoney accept-bounty --bountyId 111 --address addr1*
```

## `link-bounty`

This command should only be executed in Github PRs, otherwise it will throw an
error. Allows the contributor to link the PR with the bounty.

### Args

- `bountyId`: the id of the bounty, which can be found in the bot response of the
  `create-bounty` comment in the issue that describes the task.

Here's the example of a comment that can be used to link the PR with the bounty with
id `111`.

```
/githoney link-bounty --bountyId 111
```
