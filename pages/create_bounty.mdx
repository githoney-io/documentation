# Create a new bounty

This guide will explain how maintainers can create a new bounty by attaching it
to a Github issue.

## Create an issue

The process starts by creating a normal Github issue. There's no requirement or
constraing for the issue, it can follow whatever conventions or good practices
you have defined for your organization / repository.

For bug fixes, we recommend to include:
- Clear reproduction steps.
- Expected outcomes or acceptance criteria.

For new features, describe:
- All requirements.
- A clear definition of "done."

This clarity helps potential contributors understand the task and increases the chances of a successful outcome.

## Attach a bounty

Once you have created the issue that represents the work, the next step is
to attach a bounty. You can do that by adding a comment in the issue that
starts with `/githoney` and calls the `attach-bounty` command.

The `attach-bounty` command requires you to define the following parameters:

- `amount`: The size of the bounty in ADA currency. The developer who fulfills
 the bounty will receive 95% of this amount. (Minimum: 10 ADA)
- `deadline`: The time interval in days starting now that the contributor has available
  to fulfill the task. (Minimum: 6 days)
- `address`: Your Cardano wallet address to fund the bounty.
- `network` The network on which the contract will be created. It only accepts
  two values `preprod` and `mainnet`. If this parameter is ignored, it will be
  set to "preprod" by default.

<Callout type="warning">
  If the address format does not match with the network, the contract creation
  will fail.
</Callout>

Here's the example of the body of a comment that can be used to attach a bounty
in mainnet that provides a reward of 500 ADA, that needs to fulfilled within 60
days and that will be deposited from the address `addr1xxx`.

```
/githoney attach-bounty --amount 500 --address addr1q9dmgalc57pqpehn3pmgexawztyrw2tckwhavpexpp35tsey05ppwrzmf2kmjwjecj30xtgfezzghtzmqkttyfu3ragqrlsz3d --deadline 60 --network mainnet
```

<Callout type="info">
  For detailed information on available commands please refer to the [Bot
  commands](./bot_commands) section of the documentation.
</Callout>

The GitGoney bot will acknowledge your command with a üëç. It'll then create a custom on-chain contract for your bounty, which might take a few minutes. Once done, the bot will comment with a link to deposit the reward.

## Deposit the reward

To execute the deposit, click the link provided by the bot in response to the `attach-bounty` command. This will lead you to a straightforward web page that presents the required on-chain transaction for your signature. Ensure that the wallet you use corresponds to the address you provided in the `attach-bounty` command.

One of the main advantages of using on-chain contract is providing strong enough
guarantees for all parties involved that the conditions of the bounty will be
fulfilled.

The bounty contract requires the maintainer to lock (deposit) the corresponding
reward amount in the on-chain contract serving as an escrow mechanism. If the
final PR is completed, reviewed and merged, the bot will get notified and call
the on-chain contract to release reward without any actions required from the
maintainer side.

<Callout type="info" emoji="üçØ">
  **Project Sustainability:** To keep the Githoney hive thriving, a small fee - 5% of the bounty amount upon completion plus a fixed 2 ADA initiation fee - is collected. This supports the platform's ongoing operation and development. If the bounty is canceled or remains unfulfilled, the 5% facilitation fee is not deducted.
</Callout>

** Important Notes: **

- Refunds:  If the bounty is not completed or is canceled by you, the maintainer, you can reclaim your deposited ADA, minus the 2 ADA initiation fee. 
- Wallet Match:  Ensure you use the same wallet address you specified in the `attach-bounty` command when making the deposit.
