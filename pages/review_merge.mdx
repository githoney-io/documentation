# Review & merge PR

Once a contributor has submitted a pull request (PR) to fulfill a bounty, it's the maintainer's responsibility to carefully review the proposed solution.

## Review Process
- Thorough Examination: Carefully examine the code changes, test the functionality, and ensure the PR meets all the requirements outlined in the original bounty issue.
- Constructive Feedback: Provide clear and helpful feedback to the contributor if there are any areas for improvement or adjustments needed.
- Collaboration: Engage in open communication with the contributor to discuss any questions or concerns and work towards a mutually agreeable solution.

## Merging the PR

Once you are satisfied with the PR and it meets the acceptance criteria of the bounty, you can proceed to merge it.

## Githoney Automation

Upon merging the PR, the Githoney bot will automatically:

- Update Bounty Status: Change the bounty status to "Completed".
- Initiate Payout: Trigger the smart contract to release the reward to the contributor's wallet.
- Notify Contributor: Inform the contributor that the bounty has been successfully completed and the reward has been paid.
