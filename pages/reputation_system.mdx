# Reputation System

Githoney uses a reputation system to recognize and reward contributions from both maintainers and contributors. Your reputation score helps build trust and showcase your track record on the platform.


## How It Works

- Three Roles, Three Scores: Users have separate reputation scores for their roles as contributors, maintainers and sponsors.
- Earning Points: You earn points for completing bounties, creating bounties that get fulfilled, and sponsoring bounties.
- Losing Points: You might lose points for uncompleted claimed bounties, missed deadlines, or other actions that negatively impact the community.

## Reputation Changes

Here's a breakdown of how reputation points are calculated for different actions:

- On Merge (Bounty Completed)
    - Maintainer (Bounty Creator):
        - +5 points for creating the bounty
        - +5 points for successful completion
        - +1 point for every 100 ADA deposited in the bounty
    - Contributor:
        - +10 points for completing the bounty
        - +1 point for their current streak level (0 to 3)
        - +1 point for every 100 ADA in the bounty
    - Sponsor:
        - +1 point for the bounty being completed
        - +1 point for every 100 ADA they sponsored
- On Close (A Claimed Bounty Closed without Merge)
    - Maintainer: -10 points
- On Deadline (A Claimed Bounty Expires)
    - Contributor:
        - -5 points for not completing the bounty
        - -1 point for every 200 ADA in the bounty
